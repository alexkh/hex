* Random selection of edges

In the instruction:
"The procedure should run through all possible undirected edges, say
(i,j) and place the edge in the graph if a random probability
calculation is less than the density." 
contradicts:
"So a graph whose density is 0.1 would have 10% of its edges picked at
random and its edge distance would be selected at random from the
distance range."

The first alternative does not guarantee that the correct number of
edges be created. I implemented the second alternative instead, where
the correct number of edges are picked, it is only which ones are picked
which is random.

* int Edge::start_get(void) const
The "const" at the end of the function header applies to the "this"
pointer. This allows to call edge.start_get() in another function, even
if the edge is being declared const.
Otherwise, trying to take away the const gives a compilation error.
This is interesting for member function that must not modify the object.

* control of output
iomanip contains functions to set the field width, and double precision
of iostream output.

Variable name "new_edge": no pun intended :)

* New type
"unsigned" can be used as a type. This is useful in for loops comparing to
std::vector.size(), to avoid type mismatch warnings. Leaving out the "int" in
"unsigned int" saves place and keystrokes.

* iterator
Iterators seemed obscure at first, but are easier to use than I thought. I am
not yet sure why they are better than just going for indeces, but they seem the
standard way to deal with vectors and lists.

* list
I implemented the priority queue as a vector first, until I found the class
list. It allows to insert elements in the middle without the need to shift the
rest of the elements.

* using namespace
I learned it is bad practice to have "using namespace" in header files, it might
change the meaning of the code in files that include the header. I keep
forgetting the "std::" needed in the header files, though.

* default parameter in function definition
Unlike C, where "void func()" says that func() takes any number of parameters,
C++ makes it void, the default. I haven't replaces the function definitions
where I wrote void, but will not have it in the future.
