* Random selection of edges

In the instruction:
"The procedure should run through all possible undirected edges, say
(i,j) and place the edge in the graph if a random probability
calculation is less than the density." 
contradicts:
"So a graph whose density is 0.1 would have 10% of its edges picked at
random and its edge distance would be selected at random from the
distance range."

The first alternative does not guarantee that the correct number of
edges be created. I implemented the second alternative instead, where
the correct number of edges are picked, it is only which ones are picked
which is random.

* int Edge::start_get(void) const
The "const" at the end of the function header applies to the "this"
pointer. This allows to call edge.start_get() in another function, even
if the edge is being declared const.
Otherwise, trying to take away the const gives a compilation error.

* control of output
iomanip contains functions to set the field width, and double precision
of iostream output.

Variable name "new_edge": no pun intended :)
