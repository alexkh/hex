* TODO Graph class
** DONE Set of constructors
   Is there really a need for several? -> one with no edges, one with a list of
   edges. 
** TODO Add edges
   Positive cost, undirected (think of connectivity matrix, only a triangle
   matix).
** TODO Dijkstra's algorithm as a member function


* TODO Random initialization of graphes
** TODO As a procedure
** TODO edge density and distance range as parameters
   Pick a number of edges randomly from all possible edges (not a probabililty
   of being an edge, for all edges).

* TODO main program
** TODO Compute a set of randomly generated graphs
** TODO Compute an average shortest path

* TODO Comments
** TODO 200 words on what you learned
** TODO Output showing the average path length calculation
   Densities 20 %, 40 %, 50 nodes, distance within [1.0; 10.0]. Only average
   from vertix 1 to all others (omit the value if no path is found).

* TODO Running changes
** TODO edge_add() must check if the edge does not already exist
